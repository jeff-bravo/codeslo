    <h2>What is the Mozilla Developer Network?</h2>
    <p class="color-one">MDN Web Docs, previously Mozilla Developer Network and formerly Mozilla Developer Center, is the official Mozilla website
        for development documentation of web standards and Mozilla projects</p>
    (source: www.wikipedia.org accessed 17-July-2018)
    <p>History The project was started in 2005, and initially led by Mozilla Corporation employee Deb Richardson in 2005. Documentation
        efforts have been led by Eric Shepherd since 2006.

        <p>The initial content for the website was provided by
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Meta_docs/DevEdge" target="_blank">DevEdge</a>, for which the Mozilla Foundation was granted a license by AOL. The site now contains a mix of content
            migrated from DevEdge and mozilla.org, as well as original and more up-to-date content.[4][5] Documentation was
            also migrated from XULPlanet.com.</p>

        <p>MDN has a discussion forum and an IRC channel
            <a href="irc://mdn">#mdn</a> (link opens MDN channel on your system's installed IRC client) on the Mozilla IRC Network. MDN is funded
            by the Mozilla Corporation with servers and employees.</p>

        With the release on Oct 3, 2016, Brave web browser features Mozilla Developer Network as one of its search engines option.
        [6] About MDN Mozilla Developer Network is a resource for developers, maintained by the community of developers and
        technical writers and hosting many documents on a wide variety of subjects, such as: HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Web
        APIs, Node.js, WebExtensions and MathML. For mobile web developers, MDN provides documentation on subjects such as
        building a HTML5 mobile app, building a mobile add-on, and location-aware apps.</p>
